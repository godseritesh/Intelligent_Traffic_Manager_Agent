# Traffic Management System using Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning
===========================================================

## Overview
-----------

This project presents a novel approach to traffic management using machine learning, combining computer vision, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning to optimize traffic signal timings and reduce traffic congestion.

## System Components
--------------------

### 1. Traffic Monitoring System

* Uses computer vision to analyze live camera feeds and detect traffic congestion
* Utilizes OpenCV to process video feeds and detect the number of vehicles in each lane

### 2. Graph Neural Network

* Models the traffic network and predicts traffic congestion using a graph neural network
* Implemented using PyTorch Geometric library

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Agent

* Optimizes traffic signal timings using reinforcement learning
* Utilizes the FRAP algorithm to learn the optimal traffic signal timings
